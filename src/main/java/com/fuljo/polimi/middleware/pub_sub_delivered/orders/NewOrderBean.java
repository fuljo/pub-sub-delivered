 * Representation of a newly created order for the REST API.

 * the order for the first time, as it lacks:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The order id, which will be generated by the backend</li>
 *     <li>The customer id, which will be derived from the authentication cookie of the user</li>
 *     <li>The total price, which will be calculated by the backend from the unitary prices of the items</li>
 * </ul>
 * All these missing information will be filled at the moment of submission: all orders stored in the topics will
 * always have all the correct fields.
